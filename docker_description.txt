#Summary

This is a dockerfile used to port the Graphene project (found here: https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene) to run in a docker container. We are primarily concerned with running the docker instance
using Graphene-SGX. As a result this build only details how to configure Graphene-SGX.

Important Notes:
	- This build only runs through creating the tutorial. Actual usage should refer to the official documentation.
	- The key being used is some private key generated and shared publicly on github. It is not private
	- Graphene requires access to the source code for the driver so it is include. I do not update the actual driver. You may wish to change your driver to 1.8 (included) if you have problems.
	- Graphene and the driver are not included as submodules due to modifications that needed to be made.

#Setup

(Note all docker commands on the server require prepending sudo. For best practice we should change this.)

This should already have been done in njriasan on the server. If you reach problems in running a later step try redoing this.

git clone https://github.com/njriasan/graphene-docker.git

cd graphene-docker

## build the docker instance (must be inside graphene-docker)

docker build . (take the final hash produced END_HASH)

## Install the gsgx driver (this should already be done. Even if rebuild please skip this unless you encounter an issue)

cd graphene/Pal/src/host/Linux-SGX/sgx-driver

make

	# This will prompt you asking where the driver code is and what version. The answers are:
        >>> (PATH TO GRAPHENE DOCKER)/graphene-docker/linux-sgx-driver
        >>> 1.8


sudo ./load.sh

cd ../../../../../../

## Run the docker container

docker run -d --device /dev/isgx --device /dev/gsgx --device /dev/mei0 --name graphene END_HASH

#Launching Docker

docker exec -t -i graphene bash


#Running the Sample Demo from Inside the Container



## Initial Build

cd graphene

make clean

make SGX=1

	# This will prompt you asking where the driver code is and what version. The answers are:
	>>> /linux-sgx-driver
	>>> 1.8



### Testing the Native Code

cd /graphene/LibOS/shim/test/native

make clean

make SGX=1

make SGX_RUN=1

SGX=1 ./pal_loader helloworld 


### Testing the Python Script

cd /graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/python

make clean

make SGX=1

make SGX_RUN=1

SGX=1 ./python.manifest.sgx scripts/helloworld.py


#Possible Problems

- The source code for the driver may not match the installed driver.

- make clean is not recursive throughout graphene and may require another attempt
